# Complete code for the application
Bayesian discrete conditional transformation models (BDCTMs) provide an overarching model framework for situations where e.g. count hurdle or (non-)proportional odds models with nonlinear (interaction) effects is due. Inference via MCMC is based on the No-U-Turn sampler.
